### Why?
I wrote this because TI decided to remove assembly functionality from the latest OS version.
This doesn't help with that at all, I'm just being petty.
It's also highly ironic to have an interpreted program emulate the ISA it's running on.
If anyone wants to take this a step further and run TI-BASIC inside of this, that would be awesome.
